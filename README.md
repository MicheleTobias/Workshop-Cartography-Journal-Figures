# Cartography for Map Figures in Academic Journals & Books

Author: Michele Tobias

**This workshop is a work in progress.  Please check back later for the finished product.  Target completion date: December 2020**

This workshop will discuss approaches and guidelines for creating map figures for academic books and journals.  We'll use QGIS to illustrate one workflow in a graphical GIS.  This general workflow can be applied to other graphical GIS programs or even programming environments.

How are map figures different from other maps you might make?
resticted size
restricted color pallette


KEY CONCEPT: MINIMIZE!


## Journal Art Specifications


## Page Set Up
Once you know your art specs, set up your page in the print composer/layout manager

## Background Data
Don't use "base maps" or pre-assembled data tiles unless you have to.  Vector data is better for clear line work.  
Almost NEVER use an airphoto.
What does the reader need to understand your map?
Licensing - Can you cite your data?  Are you allowed to publish it?


## Fonts
8 pt or larger

## Color Hierarchy
... grays vs. blacks


## Legends & Other Map Elements
